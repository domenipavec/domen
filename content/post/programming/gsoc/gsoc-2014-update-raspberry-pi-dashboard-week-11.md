This week I added interfaces for GPIO (input, output, PWM and tone), I2C, SPI and shift in/out to the Dashboard. Additionally I have also researched WebSockets that I will use for serial and GPIO updating.

Next week I will try to use WebSockets for serial and GPIO implementations. There are also a few smaller things that need to be fixed/updated.

Code is on [github](https://github.com/matematik7/rpi-dashboard).
