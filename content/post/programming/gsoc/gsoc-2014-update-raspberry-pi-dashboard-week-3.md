This week I was working on a JavaScript library for accessing REST api. I implemented it as a jQuery plugin. It contains functions for ajax request to REST api, formatting the numbers and calculating rate for throughput.

I also wrote documentation for the library.

I have created an example page, that displays some data from REST api with the new RPiJS plugin.

Next week I will start creating the Dashboard using AngularJS.

Code is on [github](https://github.com/matematik7/duda-raspberry).
