This week I updated the documentation, wrote installation instructions for Raspbian, Pidora and Arch Linux, updated the Dashboard a bit and fixed two memory leaks using valgrind.

Besides programming I also created a website for the project that contains project description, full documentation, screenshots and link to a demo version of the Dashboard. I wrote a [post](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=81578) about the Dashboard on the official Raspberry Pi forum and got some positive feedback.

Next week I will be working on the GPIO interface for the Dashboard.

Code is on [github](https://github.com/matematik7/duda-raspberry).
